*An always-on autonomous AI daemon with desktop awareness, multi-agent hierarchy, visual workflows, and goal pursuit.*

JARVIS is not a chatbot with tools. It is a persistent daemon that sees your screen, understands what you're doing, and acts — within the authority limits you define. Run it on a server for 24/7 availability, then connect sidecars on your laptop, desktop, or any other machine to give it eyes and hands everywhere.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
bun install -g @usejarvis/brain   # Install the daemon
jarvis start -d                   # Start as background daemon
```

Open `http://localhost:3142` — the dashboard walks you through LLM provider, voice, and a quick conversational profile interview the first time you visit.

---

## ☁️ Managed Hosting

Don't want to deal with servers, DNS, or TLS certificates? We've partnered with **[opencove.host](https://opencove.host)** — a managed hosting platform built specifically for JARVIS.

- **No self-hosting hassle** — no server to provision, no dependencies to install
- **Dedicated domain included** — no need to buy a domain or configure DNS and TLS
- **Up and running in under 5 minutes** — spin up your JARVIS instance and start using it immediately

Visit [opencove.host](https://opencove.host) to get started.

---

## 💡 Use Cases

**Research while you work** — Ask JARVIS to deep-dive a topic. It runs browser searches, reads pages, and compiles a summary in the background while you focus on other things.

**Automate across machines** — Run the daemon on your home server. Connect sidecars on your work laptop and your desktop. JARVIS can move files between them, run scripts on your server, and open apps on your laptop — all from one conversation.

**Inbox triage** — Set up a workflow that monitors your Gmail, categorizes incoming messages, drafts replies for your review, and schedules follow-ups on your calendar.

**Desktop co-pilot** — JARVIS watches your screen via the sidecar. If it sees you struggling with an error message or a complex form, it proactively offers help or fills in fields for you.

**Goal accountability** — Define OKRs in the Goals dashboard. JARVIS plans your day each morning, checks in during the evening, and escalates if you're falling behind — like a personal drill sergeant.

**Multi-step workflows** — Build visual automations with 50+ node types: "when a file appears in this folder, OCR it, extract key data, update the spreadsheet, and notify me on Telegram."

---

## 📋 Requirements

- **Bun** >= 1.0 (installed automatically if missing)
- **OS (native daemon install)**: macOS, Linux, or WSL
- **Windows**: use WSL2 for the Bun install, or Docker for the daemon
- **LLM API key** — at least one of: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, or a local Ollama instance
- Google OAuth credentials (optional — Calendar and Gmail integration)
- Telegram bot token (optional — notification channel)
- Discord bot token (optional — notification channel)
- ElevenLabs API key (optional — premium TTS)

---

## 📦 Installation

### bun (recommended)

```bash
bun install -g @usejarvis/brain
jarvis start
```

The first time you run `jarvis start`, the daemon boots in setup mode and the dashboard at `http://localhost:3142` guides you through LLM provider, voice (TTS) choice, a conversational profile interview, and a 10-minute spotlight tour.

> **Restart after first-time setup:** The daemon constructs background services (heartbeat, commitments, awareness) at boot, gated on setup having already been completed. Once you finish setup in the dashboard, those services don't activate until the next start — the dashboard shows a banner reminding you. Run `jarvis restart` (or stop/start) to bring them online. This will go away in a follow-up that constructs the services in-process at setup completion.

> **Note:** Native Windows installs are blocked for the JARVIS daemon. On Windows, use WSL2 for the Bun install above, or use the Docker install instead.

### Docker

Run JARVIS on any OS with a single command — no Bun or dependencies required. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Windows, macOS, Linux) if you don't have Docker yet.

```bash
docker run -d --name jarvis \
  -p 3142:3142 \
  -v jarvis-data:/data \
  -e JARVIS_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key \
  ghcr.io/vierisid/jarvis:latest
```

The image is available on [GHCR](https://ghcr.io/vierisid/jarvis). Configuration can be provided via environment variables or by mounting a `config.yaml` into the `/data` volume.

> **Note:** Docker runs in an isolated container, so the daemon inside it cannot access your host desktop, browser, or clipboard directly. You must still install the [sidecar](#️-sidecar-setup) on each machine where you want JARVIS to have desktop awareness and automation capabilities.

### One-liner

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vierisid/jarvis/main/install.sh | bash
jarvis start
```

The install script sets up Bun, clones the repo, and links the `jarvis` CLI. Then run `jarvis start` and finish setup in your browser at `http://localhost:3142`.

> **Note:** The one-liner only supports macOS, Linux, and WSL. Native Windows shells such as PowerShell, Git Bash, and CMD should use WSL2 or the Docker install instead.

### Manual

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vierisid/jarvis.git ~/.jarvis/daemon
cd ~/.jarvis/daemon
bun install
bun run build:ui
jarvis start
```

Then open `http://localhost:3142` to finish setup in the dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
jarvis start            # Start in foreground
jarvis start -d         # Start as background daemon
jarvis start --port 3142 # Start on a specific port
jarvis stop             # Stop the daemon
jarvis status           # Check if running
jarvis doctor           # Verify environment & connectivity
jarvis logs -f          # Follow live logs
```

The dashboard is available at `http://localhost:3142` once the daemon is running.

### Updating

`jarvis update` detects how you installed JARVIS and runs the right update command. Equivalent manual commands per install method:

| Install method | `jarvis update` dispatches to |
| --- | --- |
| Bun global (`bun install -g @usejarvis/brain`) | `bun update -g @usejarvis/brain` |
| `install.sh` (git clone under `~/.jarvis/daemon`) | `git pull --ff-only` + `bun install` |
| Docker | Refused — run `docker pull <image> && docker rm -f jarvis && docker run ...` on the host |
| Developer checkout | Refused — run `git pull` yourself |

Run `jarvis doctor` to see what was detected and the exact commands for your install.

### Removing JARVIS

`jarvis uninstall` stops the daemon, removes autostart hooks, deletes `~/.jarvis`, and — where applicable — runs the correct package-manager uninstall. It does **not** touch sidecars.

| Install method | `jarvis uninstall` dispatches to |
| --- | --- |
| Bun global | `bun uninstall -g @usejarvis/brain` + side-effect cleanup |
| `install.sh` | `rm -rf ~/.jarvis/daemon` + CLI wrapper + side-effect cleanup |
| Docker | Refused — run `docker rm -f jarvis` (and optionally `docker volume rm jarvis-data`) on the host |
| Developer checkout | Side-effect cleanup only — your checkout is left in place |

> **Tip:** If you already ran `bun uninstall -g @usejarvis/brain` without going through `jarvis uninstall`, your daemon may still be running and `~/.jarvis` is still on disk. Run `jarvis doctor` before uninstalling to see what will be cleaned up, or stop the daemon and remove `~/.jarvis` manually.

---

## 🖥️ Sidecar Setup

The sidecar is what gives JARVIS physical reach beyond the machine it runs on. It is a lightweight agent that you install on any machine — your laptop, a dev server, a home PC — and it connects back to the central daemon over an authenticated WebSocket. Each sidecar gives JARVIS access to that machine's desktop, browser, terminal, filesystem, clipboard, and screenshots.

This means you can run the daemon on an always-on server and still interact with your desktop machines as if JARVIS were running locally. Enroll as many sidecars as you want.

### 1. Install the sidecar

**Via bun:**

```bash
bun install -g @usejarvis/sidecar
```

**Or download the binary** from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/vierisid/jarvis/releases) for your platform (macOS, Linux, Windows).

### 2. Enroll in the dashboard

1. Open the JARVIS dashboard at `http://localhost:3142`
2. Go to **Settings** → **Sidecar**
3. Enter a friendly name for this machine (e.g. "work laptop") and click **Enroll**
4. Click **Copy** to copy the token command

### 3. Run the sidecar

Paste and run the copied command on the machine where you installed the sidecar:

```bash
jarvis-sidecar --token <your-token>
```

The sidecar saves the token locally, so on subsequent runs you just need:

```bash
jarvis-sidecar
```

Once connected, the sidecar appears as online in the Settings page where you can configure its capabilities (terminal, filesystem, desktop, browser, clipboard, screenshot, awareness).

## 🧠 Core Capabilities

**Conversations** — Multi-provider LLM routing (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Ollama). Streaming responses, personality engine, vault-injected memory context on every message.

**Tool Execution** — 14+ builtin tools with up to 200 iterations per turn. The agent loop runs until the task is complete, not until the response looks done.

**Memory & Knowledge** — Vault knowledge graph (entities, facts, relationships) stored in SQLite. Extracted automatically after each response. Injected into the system prompt so JARVIS always remembers what matters.

**Browser Control** — Auto-launches Chromium via CDP. 7 browser tools handle navigation, interaction, extraction, and form filling.

**Desktop Automation** — Go sidecar with JWT-authenticated WebSocket, RPC protocol, and binary streaming. Win32 API automation (EnumWindows, UIAutomation, SendKeys) on Windows, X11 tools on Linux.

**Multi-Agent Hierarchy** — `delegate_task` and `manage_agents` tools. An AgentTaskManager coordinates 9 specialist roles. Sub-agents are denied governed actions — authority stays with the top-level agent.

**Voice Interface** — Edge TTS or ElevenLabs with streaming sentence-by-sentence playback. Binary WebSocket protocol carries mic audio (WebM) and TTS audio (MP3) on the same connection. Wake word via openwakeword (ONNX, runs in-browser).

**Continuous Awareness** — Full desktop capture at 5-10 second intervals. Hybrid OCR (Tesseract.js) + Cloud Vision. Struggle detection, activity session inference, entity-linked context graph. Proactive suggestions and an overlay widget.

**Workflow Automation** — Visual builder powered by `@xyflow/react`. 50+ nodes across 5 categories. Triggers: cron, webhook, file watch, screen events, polling, clipboard, process, git, email, calendar. NL chat creation, YAML export/import, retry + fallback + AI-powered self-heal.

**Goal Pursuit** — OKR hierarchy (objective → key result → daily action). Google-style 0.0-1.0 scoring. Morning planning, evening review, drill sergeant escalation. Awareness pipeline auto-advances progress. Three dashboard views: kanban, timeline, metrics.

**Authority & Autonomy** — Runtime enforcement with soft-gate approvals. Multi-channel approval delivery (chat, Telegram, Discord). Full audit trail. Emergency pause/kill controls. Consecutive-approval learning suggests auto-approve rules.

---

## 🎛️ Dashboard

Built with React 19 and Tailwind CSS 4. Served by the daemon at `http://localhost:3142`.

| Page | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Chat | Primary conversation interface with streaming |
| Tasks | Active commitments and background work queue |
| Content Pipeline | Multi-step content generation and review |
| Knowledge Graph | Visual vault explorer — entities, facts, relationships |
| Memory | Raw vault search and inspection |
| Calendar | Google Calendar integration with scheduling tools |
| Agent Office | Multi-agent delegation status and role management |
| Command Center | Tool history, execution logs, proactive notifications |
| Authority | Approval queue, permission rules, audit trail |
| Awareness | Live desktop feed, activity timeline, suggestions |
| Workflows | Visual builder, execution monitor, version history |
| Goals | OKR dashboard — kanban, timeline, and metrics views |
| Settings | LLM providers, TTS/STT, channels, behavior config |

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

JARVIS stores its configuration at `~/.jarvis/config.yaml`. Open the dashboard at `http://localhost:3142` after `jarvis start` for guided setup — it walks through LLM provider, voice, and a profile interview the first time. The Settings room lets you tweak channels, personality, and authority later.

```yaml
daemon:
  port: 3142
  data_dir: "~/.jarvis"
  db_path: "~/.jarvis/jarvis.db"

llm:
  primary: "anthropic"
  fallback: ["openai", "gemini", "ollama"]
  anthropic:
    api_key: "sk-ant-..."
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-6"

personality:
  core_traits: ["loyal", "efficient", "proactive"]
  assistant_name: "Jarvis"

authority:
  default_level: 3

active_role: "personal-assistant"
```

See [config.example.yaml](config.example.yaml) for the full reference including Google OAuth, Telegram, Discord, ElevenLabs, and voice settings.

```

The **daemon** is the brain — it holds the LLM connections, memory vault, agent hierarchy, and all decision-making. It can run on a home server, a VPS, or your local machine.

**Sidecars** are the hands. Each sidecar is a lightweight Go binary that connects to the daemon and exposes its host machine's capabilities. The daemon can orchestrate actions across all connected sidecars simultaneously. Sidecars authenticate via JWT and communicate over a binary WebSocket protocol.

This separation means JARVIS stays reachable 24/7 on a server while still being able to see your screen, type in your apps, and manage files on any machine where a sidecar is running.

## 🔒 Security

JARVIS includes a built-in authority engine that gates every action at runtime. All tool executions are logged in an audit trail, and sensitive operations require explicit approval via the dashboard, Telegram, or Discord. Emergency pause and kill controls are always available.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately by emailing the maintainer rather than opening a public issue.
